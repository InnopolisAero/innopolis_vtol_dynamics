# Test scenarios

Here we have a few test scenarios:

## 1. Takeoff And Land Scenario ([takeoff_and_land.plan](takeoff_and_land.plan))

This is the simplest possible test scenario: take off, wait a few seconds, and land. It is the fastest scenario and it is intended to be triggered on every commit as part of CI.
